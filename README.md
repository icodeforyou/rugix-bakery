Rugix Bakery is part of [Rugix](https://rugix.org), an open-source tool suite for building robust, Linux-powered products.

Rugix Bakery makes building OTA-ready system images (almost) **as easy as writing a Dockerfile**. Spend your time on what provides value to your users, not system-level details and build pipeline complexity.

- **Supported Distributions**: Debian, Alpine Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS.
- **OTA Updates**: Over-the-air update capabilities powered by [Rugix Ctrl](https://github.com/rugix/rugix) out of the box.
- **Container-Based Builds**: Reproducible build environment from source to image.
- **System Variants**: Support for multiple configurations including test setups.
- **Integrated Testing**: Built-in system testing framework based on VMs.
- **SBOM Generation**: Built-in SBOM generation for regulatory compliance.

With Rugix, you get a **comprehensive tool suite to build, test, and run your system** similar to what you will find with modern software development tooling, like [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (Rust) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python).

[**Get started today! Build your first system and deploy an update, all in under 30 minutes!**](https://rugix.org/docs/getting-started) 🚀

## Using Rugix Ctrl with Other Build Systems

Rugix Bakery is the easiest way to get started, but it's not the only option. If you already have a favorite build system or must use Yocto, you can integrate [Rugix Ctrl](https://github.com/rugix/rugix) directly using our [open-source Yocto layers](https://github.com/rugix/meta-rugix).
